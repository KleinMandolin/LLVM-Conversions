# LLVM-Conversions
Samantha Brewer's research into automated conversion of source code to LLVM Intermediate Representation for VICEROY internship summer 2024. This was part of a larger project, Automated Rapid Verification and Validation of Software.

The purpose of the LLVM IR conversion step was to show a proof of concept for multi-platform verification (e.g. running C/C++ vulnerability scanners on Rust code), as well as provide a consistent input for later behavioral model generation via ChatGPT (not included).
